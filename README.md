# Gitpod Space for Pair Programming with a Large Language Model

This is a spoace for [Pair Programming with a Large Language Model](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/pair-programming-llm/) configured for ephemeral cloud development environments on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

## Next Steps

Click the button below to start a new development environment:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/eggressive/ng-deeplearning/)

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

## Pair Programming with a Large Language Model

### First prebuild

Start your first workspace with a prebuild by prefixing https://gitpod.io#prebuild/ to the URL of the repository.
The revised URL is: https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/eggressive/ng-deeplearning

Gitpod displays the prebuild progress status by running the init commands in the .gitpod.yml file before you even start a workspace. Later, when you create a new workspace on a branch, or pull/merge request the workspace loads much faster, because all dependencies are already downloaded and the code is compiled. For more information see [prebuilds](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds).
